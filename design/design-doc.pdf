I hope to create a site that has room for growth and also could be very simple. I love websites such as googlemaps.com, yelp.com, and the random blog posts from all over that go out and rate the best places to eat, drink, hike, visit. Well, one of my favorite things in Seattle is the coffee shops and not just Seattle, but all over the Pacific North West. Making up the Pacific North West (PNW) is Oregon, British Columbia, Idaho, and Washington. I find a unique vibe here and I want to explore it more, share my finds, and bring forth the best of what I find. From the everyday coffee shop to a random speakeasy hiding in capitol hill. There is a place to be found here and I'd like to think that with that I have a bit of skill in telling when something is good or bad. I want this to be from the local's eye, the places that take you always a couple visits for a solid push out of your normal daily circle to find, and of course the ones you keep going back to for good reason not just your corner Starbucks. 

I looked at a couple great sites to find some inspiration:

A Couple Links of some distinct Ideas I want to use as key concepts: 

https://www.tomsguide.com/reviews/apple-airpods-pro - A very distinct rating, pros and cons (this is still up for debate)
https://medium.com/ - for its contrast, simplicity, and ease of use
